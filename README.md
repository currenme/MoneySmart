MoneySmart
================

MoneySmart is an interactive web application made by myself and my friend William Lin during the 35-hour USC Hackation HackSC (Spring 2014). MoneySmart provides interactive retirement and savings calculators and predictive models for users. We built this from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the open-source Chart.JS library.
